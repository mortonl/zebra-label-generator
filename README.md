# Zebra Label Generator

A Java library that simplifies the generation of Zebra Printer Label (ZPL) commands, supporting barcodes, graphics, text
elements, and printer settings with a fluid and intuitive interface.

## Overview

This library provides a programmatic way to create ZPL label format commands, focusing on DPI-agnostic label generation.
It's designed to make working with Zebra printers more straightforward and maintainable in Java applications.

## Project Status

This project is currently under active development. While the core functionality is being implemented, contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Features

### Current Features

- **Comprehensive Set of ZPL II Commands**
    - Near-complete set of constants and commands for ZPL II.
- **Clean and Type-Safe Java API**
    - Intuitive APIs for label generation using Java.
- **DPI-Agnostic Label Creation**
    - Design labels without worrying about printer DPI; the library handles conversions.
- **Barcode Support**
    - Standardized barcode framework with validation and positioning.
    - Support for multiple barcode types:
    - Code 128
    - Interleaved 2 of 5
    - PDF417
- **Graphics and Text Elements**
    - Create graphic boxes, lines, and text with various fonts and formatting.
- **Position Validation**
    - Ensure all elements are correctly placed within label boundaries.
- **Configurable Validation Levels**
    - Control element validation with `STRICT`, `NORMAL`, `LENIENT`, or `OFF` levels.
- **Fluid Builders with `addToLabel()` Method**
    - Simplify the creation and addition of elements to labels in a single, fluent chain.

### Planned Features

- Elements for more Commands including:
    - Additional Barcode Types
    - More graphic types
        - Circle
        - Diagonal Lines
        - Ellipses
        - Symbols
- Graphic field validation
    - I currently don't understand some of the examples I've seen of graphic fields being used where non-hex characters
      were used in a hex command, when I can learn more about how this functionality is supposed to work I will add
      better validation.
- Setting defaults for the label
    - Warning when setting an item the same as a default setting?
- Explicit mode as an alternative to using defaults?
    - This would no longer print empty parts of the Zebra command and instead use the default values for that command
      where possible or the latest relevant default set?
- Image helpers to convert to ASCII hex and binary?
- Template vs complete zpl generation?
    - Currently designed around passing actual values into elements like text and barcodes etc. we could allow field
      parameters to be provided separately and this would allow the template to be permanently stored on the printer?
- Native command support? - will there be any cases where this would be needed, would like to avoid this as it goes
  against desired Java API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management

### Installation

#### Maven

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` (ensure you use the latest version):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.mortonl</groupId>
    <artifactId>zebra-label-generator</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Gradle

Add the following to your `build.gradle` (ensure you use the latest version):

```
implementation 'io.github.mortonl:zebra-label-generator:1.1.0'
```

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the [Usage Guide](docs/USAGE.md).

## Reference Documentation

Official Zebra Programming Guide 2018 documentation is used as reference for implementation

- [Zebra Programming Guide 2018](https://support.zebra.com/cpws/docs/zpl/zpl-zbi2-pm-en.pdf)

## Inspirations

This project was created as an alternative to existing solutions, with a specific focus on:

- DPI-agnostic label generation
- More Comprehensive Validation

These projects in particular were

- [W3 Blog France / Zebra ZPL Project](https://github.com/w3blogfr/zebra-zpl)
  I was originally going to make use of this project but for many reasons I chose not to use it or fork it. In
  particular, I found I was having to rewrite a lot of the logic for my own use cases, and it wouldn't solve my initial
  wishes for DPI agnostic programmatic label creation.

## Testing Labels

You can test the ZPL output generated by this library using
the [Labelary Online ZPL Viewer](https://labelary.com/viewer.html).
Simply copy the generated ZPL code and paste it into the viewer to preview how your labels will look when printed.

The Labelary Viewer allows you to:

- Visualize labels before printing
- Verify proper placement of elements
- Check barcode formatting
- Test different label sizes and dpi configurations
- Validate ZPL syntax

This is particularly useful during development to ensure your labels are formatted correctly without
needing physical access to a Zebra printer.
